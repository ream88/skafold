{"name":"Skafold","body":"Generates HTML scaffolds the way I need it everyday as a web developer.\r\n\r\nThe days were I needed only a `index.html` as scaffold for web apps are\r\nlong gone. Today my work depends on various different frameworks:\r\n\r\n* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org)\r\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)\r\n* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) (not implemented yet)\r\n* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)\r\n* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) (not implemented yet)\r\n* [Bourbon](http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon) (not implemented yet)\r\n* [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSkafold simplifies the generation of such a scafold by reducing it into\r\none command (using the incredible [thor](https://github.com/wycats/thor) by @wycats):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nskafold APP_NAME\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngem install skafold\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
